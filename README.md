## Setting up a new story

To set up a new story, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory under `stories/` with your story name (e.g., `stories/my_new_story/`)

2. Required files to create:
   - `story.md`: The main story content
   - `beats/`: Directory containing story beats in JSON format

3. Directory structure example:
   ```
   stories/
   └── my_new_story/
       ├── story.md
       └── beats/
           └── beat_1.json
   ```

4. Run the story generation pipeline to automatically create `story_elements.json` and process the story content.

Note: The story elements will be automatically generated by the LLM based on the story content, following the schema defined in `src/py_libs/models/story_elements.py`.
